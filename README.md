The purpose of this project is to improve my C# skills, while exploring Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Language Integrated Query (LINQ).

While this project does not make use of an SQL server, I am planning on later working on project similar in scope which does.

Primary focuses:
  Object Oriented Fundamentals (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance)
  UML Diagram Drawing
  Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
  Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
  Using Git workflow in Windows Visual Studio
